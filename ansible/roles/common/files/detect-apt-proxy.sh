# detect-http-proxy - Returns a HTTP proxy which is available for use

# Author: Lekensteyn <lekensteyn@gmail.com>

# Supported since APT 0.7.25.3ubuntu1 (Lucid) and 0.7.26~exp1 (Debian Squeeze)
# Unsupported: Ubuntu Karmic and before, Debian Lenny and before

# Put this file in /etc/apt/detect-http-proxy and create and add the below
# configuration in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/30detectproxy
#    Acquire::http::ProxyAutoDetect "/etc/apt/detect-http-proxy";

# APT calls this script for each host that should be connected to. Therefore
# you may see the proxy messages multiple times (LP 814130). If you find this
# annoying and wish to disable these messages, set show_proxy_messages to 0
show_proxy_messages=1

# on or more proxies can be specified. Note that each will introduce a routing
# delay and therefore its recommended to put the proxy which is most likely to
# be available on the top. If no proxy is available, a direct connection will
# be used
